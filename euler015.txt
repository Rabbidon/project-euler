Given a 20 * 20 grid, how many routes are there from the top left to the bottom right corner if we can only go right or down along an edge.

Given the grid dimensions, we will have to go across 20 times and down 20 times. We can do these 40 actions in any order we like. There are
(by definition) 40C20 (40 choose 20) ways to do this (out of the 40 consecutive moves, we can freely pick 20 to be rightwards. The remainder
will all then be downwards, giving a valid path, and all valid paths are of this form).

40C20 evaluates to 137846528820
