Find the first member of the Fibonacci sequence to have over 1000 digits.

This one seems impractical to solve by hand, but can be easily cracked using the closed form of the Fibonaci numbers.

We can solve the Fibonacci numbers' recurrence relation

F_n = F_(n-1) + F_(n-2)

to get two general solutions, and then solve for boundary conditions (F_1 = 1, F_2 = 1), to give

F_n = ((phi)^n-(1-phi)^n)/sqrt(5)

where phi is the golden ratio. 1<phi<2, so phi^n grows large as n grows, and (1-phi)^n grows small.

Therefore we see that F_n ~ phi^n/sqrt(5) for large n (by the time F_n is large enough to have 1000 digits, n is easily large enough for this approximation to be very, very close).

We pick k s.t. (phi^k)/sqrt(5) = 10^999 (the least number with 1000 digits). Taking logs gives

k = (999*log(10)+(log(5)/2))/log(phi) ~= 4781.85927075

Therefore the first Fibonacci number to exceed 10^999 is 4782
